How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

catches unintended changes
shows all possible code changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

makes it much easier to go back to working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros:
logical checkins
user chooses size of checkins
commits make sense

cons:
can forget to checkin

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

git is made for software while docs is for documents where there is no interrelation between files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

you can see what changes were checkin in via the comments
you can compare changes using diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you can always revert to a working copy
can check versus previous version to narrow down issues

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

projects with multiple commits
