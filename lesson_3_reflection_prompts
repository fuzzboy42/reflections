When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When working with other people so everyone can access changes made by other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic pulls might leave you with unexpected changes that would take time to resolve.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Branches are for when you want to modify code for a new feature, bug fix, etc without changing the existing working code. Clones are for when you want a copy of the exisiting code on your local machine. Forks are for when you want a copy of the existing code without changing the original copy. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
